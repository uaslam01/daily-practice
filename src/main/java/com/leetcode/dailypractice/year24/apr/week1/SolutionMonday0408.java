 * Number-of-students-unable-to-eat-lunch
 * <p>
 * The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to by numbers 0 and 1 respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square or circular sandwiches.
 * <p>
 * The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:
 * <p>
 * If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
 * Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end.
 * This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat.
 * <p>
 * You are given two integer arrays students and sandwiches where sandwiches[i] is the type of the i​​​​​​th sandwich in the stack (i = 0 is the top of the stack) and students[j] is the preference of the j​​​​​​th student in the initial queue (j = 0 is the front of the queue). Return the number of students that are unable to eat.

 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation:
 * - Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,0,0,1].
 * - Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,0,1,1].
 * - Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [0,1,1] and sandwiches = [1,0,1].
 * - Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [1,1,0].
 * - Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1,0] and sandwiches = [0,1].
 * - Front student leaves the top sandwich and returns to the end of the line making students = [0,1].
 * - Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [1] and sandwiches = [1].
 * - Front student takes the top sandwich and leaves the line making students = [] and sandwiches = [].
 * Hence all students are able to eat.

 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: students = [1,1,1,0,0,1], sandwiches = [1,0,0,0,1,1]
 * Output: 3
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= students.length, sandwiches.length <= 100
 * students.length == sandwiches.length
 * sandwiches[i] is 0 or 1.
 * students[i] is 0 or 1.
 * Accepted
